We tried to colorize grayscale image using Convolutional Neural Network.
Our model is built on pretrained VGG-net model from Imagenet

To train on image dataset add its filepath in train.py and run 'python train.py' on console
Then to test an input add imagepath in test.py and run 'python test.py' on console
